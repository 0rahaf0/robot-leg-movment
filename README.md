 Control the robot leg action using Servo Motors
This document explains the algorithm that  used to control the movement of robot legs using servo motors. The robot has 4 joints in each leg, with each joint controlled by  motor, and additional servos for rotating the feet left and right.

# Movement Control Functions
pseudo-code:
-Lift left leg.
-Move left leg forward.
-Set left leg down.
-Lift right leg.
-Move right leg forward.
-Set right leg down.
-Move body forward.
-Repeat.

# more detailed explanation:
in pseudo-code that i provided outlines the basic steps for walking, focusing on alternating leg movements to propel the body forward. 

Lift left leg:

The left leg is raised off the ground, preparing it to move forward. This involves flexing the hip and knee joints.
Move left leg forward:

The left leg is swung forward in a controlled motion. The foot moves from behind the body to a position ahead of it.
Set left leg down:

The left leg is lowered to the ground, making contact with the heel first, followed by the rest of the foot. This step provides stability and prepares for the next movement.
Lift right leg:

Similar to the first step, the right leg is raised off the ground, ready to move forward. This also involves flexing the hip and knee joints, with the weight now primarily on the left leg.
Move right leg forward:

The right leg is swung forward in a controlled motion, just like the left leg, moving from behind the body to a position ahead.
Set right leg down:

The right leg is lowered to the ground, making contact with the heel first, followed by the rest of the foot, supporting the body's weight.
Move body forward:

As the right leg is set down, the body shifts forward, propelled by the forward momentum generated by the leg movements. This involves a slight shift in the center of gravity.
Repeat:

The process is repeated, alternating legs continuously to produce a walking motion. Each repetition of these steps represents one full stride in walking.
